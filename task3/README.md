1. Designing the System for Custom Domains: To allow each gaming company to serve games on their dedicated domain, you can follow these steps:

    - Custom Domains: Implement custom domain support, allowing gaming companies to associate their domain (e.g., cool-games.com, luck-games.co.uk) with their gPlatform instance.

    - Domain Mapping: When a gaming company signs up, they provide their domain. You map this domain to their specific gPlatform instance.

    - Routing and Hosting: Configure your backend cluster (which serves all companies) to route requests based on the incoming domain. Each request should be directed to the appropriate gPlatform instance associated with the requested domain.

2. Modifying the Users Table:

    - User Identification: Currently, users are identified by email. To support multiple domains, you’ll need to modify the user identification mechanism.

    - Unique User Identifier: Instead of relying solely on email, introduce a unique user identifier (e.g., a UUID or a combination of company ID and user ID). This identifier should be consistent across all gaming domains.

    - User Table Schema: Modify the users table at gPlatform to include this unique user identifier. Additionally, ensure that other user-related data (such as game progress, preferences, etc.) is associated with this identifier.

3. Validating User Logins Across Domains:

    - Single Sign-On (SSO): Implement a single sign-on (SSO) solution. When a user logs in on one gaming domain (e.g., site A), they receive an authentication token.

    - Token Validation: When the user accesses another gaming domain (e.g., site B), validate the token against the gPlatform’s authentication service. Ensure that the token corresponds to the same user and that the user has access to the requested domain.

    - Domain-Specific Claims: Include domain-specific claims in the token (e.g., the associated gaming company’s ID). Validate these claims during token validation to prevent cross-domain access.
